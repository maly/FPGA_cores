# Implementations

The core has been used in multiple implementations.  Some of the implementations are intended for Validation.  Others are intended as examples of how to use the core in specific scenarios, spread across Altera and Xilinx FPGAs.

The GODIL is an example of the core interfacing entirely with real-world components; it deals with some 'edge' issues of a 6809 and timing when signals pass outside an FPGA.

The other boards are all examples of how to use the core either completely or partially internal to an FPGA.  (Some use purely block RAM for the example.)  To read more about what the example actually is, click here.
